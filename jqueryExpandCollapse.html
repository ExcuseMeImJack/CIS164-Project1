    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>From a young age, I was inspired by technology. What drove me to it was my favorite story.</p>
    <div class="hidden-content">
      When I was 13 years old, I attended a career fair at my middle school, and that's where it all began. As I explored the Project Lead The Way booths from the high school I would soon be attending, I was immediately drawn to a motherboard. I was captivated by the blend of green and gold, and I could feel the pricks of the capacitors beneath my fingertips. At that moment, I realized I wanted to learn everything I could about it all.

    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <p>My past is a confusing one. Off-and-on college, bootcamps, and self learning. It's a lot to think about but every step helped me.</p>
    <div class="hidden-content">
      After high school, I chose to attend Cerritos College for a year and a half. However, I soon realized that I wasn't benefiting much from the curriculum, as I was already familiar with most of the material. It felt repetitive, and with the onset of the pandemic, I decided to take a two-year break. During that time, I enrolled in a bootcamp to enhance my software engineering skills. While I wasn't able to secure a position in the field afterward, I don't regret the experience. Now, I'm back at Cerritos, completing the necessary courses to earn my degree and advance my career.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>After the bootcamp, I got some experience. From hackathons to internships.</p>
    <div class="hidden-content">
      My experiences have provided me with a distinctive perspective on teamwork, user-centric design, and the development of impactful solutions. I have participated in hackathons and have gained valuable insights through various internships. My most recent and rewarding internship is with the African Marine Mammals Conservation Organization, where I work as a Frontend Developer utilizing Next.js, React, and Tailwind to create interactive designs. Currently, we are undertaking a complete overhaul of the main site. This internship enables me to pursue my passion while contributing positively to the world.
